    "The rise of machine learning and data science have allowed for significant innovation within many fields--particularly in healthcare, where there is a high potential for impact through life-saving solutions and increased hospital efficiencies. The underlying concept is to utilize previous patient experiences (and the associated data) to make predictions that could both improve conditions for future patients, increase efficiency for overbooked physicians, and greatly reduce healthcare costs. The ultimate goal in this work was to develop an algorithm that utilizes the MIMIC-III database to predict the likelihood of patient readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge. The MIMIC-III database is a collection of patient data from intensive care unit hospital stays.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of algorithm implemented in a hospital setting has great potential to improve outcomes for patients, assist physicians, and reduce healthcare costs. Particularly, hospital readmissions are a large source of healthcare costs and identifying patients that are of higher risk of readmission would lead to greater care prior to their initial discharge. Specifically, if a patient is readmitted within 30 days, it is likely that they were not healthy enough to leave the hospital at the time of discharge. In order to prevent this occurrence, there are financial penalties to incentivize hospitals to only discharge patients when they are stable enough to be discharged. Therefore, an algorithm that identifies patients who are at higher risk for a 30 day readmission would be hugely beneficial to the doctors caring for those patients. The doctors would then be able to exercise extreme caution when discharging these patients, ensuring they are in a stable enough condition to leave care. This extra caution would benefit doctors, hospitals, and most importantly the health of patients."

    "In this section, we describe a technique to reduce the number of features in the data. The reason for selecting only a subset of features is to avoid the curse of dimensionality, which asserts that the hypervolume increases much faster than observations can fill the space. If the number of features is large compared to the number of observations, a classifier trained on the data will tend to overfit the training set. An additional challenge associated with this dataset is that different types of lab tests are performed on different patients, resulting in a substantial number of missing values. This exacerbates the data sparsity problem associated with high dimensional data. To mitigate this concern, we select features that have at least 50 percent non-missing values in the training set. "

    "Therefore, the final model produces an AUC score of 0.66 and the ROC curve as seen in the figure above. It is worth noting that this AUC score of the optimized SVM is higher (as expected) than the AUC score of the original, default SVM classifier which was 0.659. While the increase in performance is marginal, every bit counts when striving for better performance."
